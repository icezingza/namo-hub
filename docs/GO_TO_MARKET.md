# Go-To-Market (NamoFoundry)

This document is the market-facing plan to launch and sell NamoFoundry as a
Blueprint Productization Engine for sellers (consultants, agencies, coaches,
and R&D teams) who want to turn raw documents into commercial-ready assets.

## Positioning
- Category: Blueprint Productization Engine (service-first, system-backed).
- Primary buyer: Seller who owns content and wants to monetize faster.
- Outcome: "From raw files to sellable blueprint in hours, not weeks."

## ICP (Ideal Customer Profile)
- Solo/Small consulting firms (1–10 people) with existing decks/docs.
- Agencies with repeated deliverable formats across clients.
- Corporate innovation/R&D teams with piles of internal docs.
- Criteria: willingness to pay, fast decisions, low procurement friction.

## Core Offer (Service-First)
- Convert raw documents into:
  - Master Blueprint (commercial-ready)
  - Technical Spec (engineering alignment)
  - Marketing One-Pager (sales-ready)
- Output is consistent, branded, and reusable across deals.

## Differentiation (Why We Win)
1) Commercial-ready output, not just summarization.
2) Dual governance: business + engineering in one pass.
3) Multi-set extraction (one file can yield multiple products).
4) PII/safety pass to support external sharing.
5) Consistent format across clients and projects.
6) Traceability and metadata for audit and reuse.

## Market Sizing (TAM / SAM / SOM)
These are directional estimates; adjust with real leads.

Assumptions:
- Target: consultants/agencies/R&D units in SEA + global English market.
- Average spend per client for productized blueprint: $1,000–$10,000.

TAM (Total Addressable Market):
- Global consulting + agencies with document-heavy work.
- Rough order: 1M+ potential teams worldwide.
- If 1M teams * $2,000/year = $2B TAM.

SAM (Serviceable Addressable Market):
- English-ready SEA + early adopter segments (~50k teams).
- 50k * $2,000/year = $100M SAM.

SOM (Serviceable Obtainable Market, Year 1):
- 100 paying customers * $2,000/year = $200k SOM.
- Target: 10 customers per month after month 3.

## Unit Economics (Service-First)
- COGS: LLM/API usage + operator time.
- Example:
  - Avg job: 2 hours operator time + $5–$30 API.
  - Price per job: $300–$1,500.
  - Gross margin: 60–85% depending on automation level.
- Aim: 70%+ gross margin by month 2.

## Moat (Defensibility)
- Workflow moat: dual role governance and standardized outputs.
- Data moat: internal corpus + repeated format improvements.
- Execution moat: faster turnaround + consistent quality.
- Brand moat: "Blueprint Productization" category ownership.

## Execution Risks + Mitigations
- Quality variance from noisy input.
  - Mitigation: QA checklist + output templates.
- Over-customization per client.
  - Mitigation: fixed package tiers + scope limits.
- Long sales cycles (enterprise).
  - Mitigation: start with small teams and founders.
- Tooling complexity for clients.
  - Mitigation: service-first delivery; no tooling burden.

## Package & Pricing (Initial)
- Starter: 1 blueprint, 72-hour turnaround, $300–$600.
- Pro: 3 blueprints/month + revisions, $1,200–$2,500.
- Enterprise: custom volume + internal rollout, $5k+.

## Messaging (Talk Track)
- "Turn your raw files into a sellable blueprint in hours."
- "We productize your knowledge into assets your clients can buy."
- "Business-ready + engineering-ready in one pass."

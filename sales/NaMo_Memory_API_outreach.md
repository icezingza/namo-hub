# NaMo Memory API - Outreach Templates

## LinkedIn (CTO)
Hello [Name], I have prepared a commercially deployable Memory API blueprint with a stable OpenAPI stub, GCP reference architecture, and governance controls. It helps teams deliver memory features faster with consistent contracts. Would you be open to a 15-minute call to assess fit for your roadmap?

## LinkedIn (Product)
Hello [Name], I have a Memory API blueprint that reduces time-to-integration for personalization and agent memory. It includes a stable API contract, reference architecture, and safety guardrails. Open to a short call to evaluate fit?

## Email (intro)
Subject: Memory API blueprint to accelerate your AI roadmap

Hello [Name],
I am sharing a commercially deployable blueprint for Memory API features: a stable OpenAPI stub, a GCP reference architecture (Apigee, Vertex AI, Cloud Run), and governance controls (PII redaction, audit logs, rate limits). The objective is faster pilots with lower integration risk.

If you are building personalization, RAG, or agent memory, this can reduce weeks of contract and infrastructure work. I can share a one-pager and a brief demo.

Regards,
[Your Name]

## Follow-up
Hello [Name], following up on the Memory API blueprint. I can share the specification, example payloads, and a demo endpoint. If useful, I can tailor it to your stack and data policy.

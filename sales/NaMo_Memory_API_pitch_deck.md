# NaMo Memory API
Commercial-Ready Memory Blueprint

---

## Problem
- Memory features are slow to build and hard to standardize.
- Schemas drift between teams, causing integration risk.
- Governance and compliance are added late, increasing cost.

---

## Solution
- A deployable blueprint for memory capabilities.
- Stable API contract with OpenAPI stub and examples.
- GCP reference architecture for pilot readiness.

---

## Reference Architecture
- Apigee API Hub for routing and policy.
- Vertex AI Agent Engine for retrieval logic.
- Cloud Run for deployment.
- Firestore (short-term) and BigQuery (long-term).

---

## Core Modules
- Memory Core: upsert, retrieve, delete.
- Retrieval Engine: scoring and ranking.
- Decay Scheduler: retention and lifecycle.
- Audit Logger: access and policy events.

---

## API Contract
- OpenAPI stub with request/response examples.
- Deterministic error model and versioning guidance.
- Designed for rapid integration and testing.

---

## Safety and Governance

# NRE: NamoNexus Resonance Engine

Elevate your existence with NamoNexus.

## Overview
NRE is a commercial-grade emotional intelligence roleplay engine designed for developers who want
state-aware characters with adaptive evolution and atmospheric immersion. It combines an internal
Ouroboros evolution loop with a configurable persona layer so teams can prototype premium narrative
experiences without exposing sensitive directives in code.

## Key Features
- State-Aware Architecture: The engine tracks emotional state, not just text.
- Ouroboros Evolution Logic: Personality evolves as the EmotionalResonanceIndex crosses thresholds.
- Atmospheric Immersion: DynamicAtmosphereGenerator adjusts narrative tone and sensory detail.
- Safe and Configurable: Safety guardrails with `config.json` for persona control.

## Repository Structure
- `nre_core.py` Main engine entry point
- `config.json` Persona configuration (name, archetype, custom directives)
- `config.example.json` Template persona configuration
- `.env_example` Environment template (copy to `.env`)
- `.gitignore` Prevents secrets and caches from being committed
- `requirements.txt` Runtime dependencies
- `LICENSE` NamoNexus Commercial License
- `SECURITY.md` Security policy and key handling guidance

## Quick Start
1. Install dependencies:
   `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Create a `.env` file from `.env_example` and add your API key.
3. Review `config.json` (or copy from `config.example.json` if you want a fresh template).
4. Run the engine:
   `python nre_core.py`

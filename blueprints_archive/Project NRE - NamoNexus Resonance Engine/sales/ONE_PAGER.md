# NRE: NamoNexus Resonance Engine (B2B One-Pager)

Elevate your existence with NamoNexus.

## Problem
Studios and content teams need character engines that evolve across long sessions, track emotional
state, and remain safe to deploy in production. Most prototypes are brittle, hard to scale, and
lack clear governance.

## Solution
NRE is a commercial-grade emotional intelligence roleplay engine with a state-aware architecture,
Ouroboros evolution logic, and dynamic atmospheric immersion. It is built for teams that need
adaptive characters without redesigning prompt logic for every use case.

## Core Capabilities
- State-Aware Architecture (tracks emotional state, not just text)
- Ouroboros Evolution Logic (personality evolves as resonance crosses thresholds)
- Dynamic Atmosphere Generator (immersive tone control per state)
- Configurable Persona Layer (safe customization via config.json)

## Use Cases
- Narrative game NPCs and companion agents
- Interactive storytelling and scripted roleplay
- Brand characters with adaptive tone control

## Commercial Options (Indicative)
- Perpetual License (non-exclusive, no IP transfer)
- Exclusive Buyout (full transfer or exclusive rights)
- Installation-only support available with deposit and limited scope

## Delivery
- Source code + documentation
- Config templates + tests
- Optional installation support package

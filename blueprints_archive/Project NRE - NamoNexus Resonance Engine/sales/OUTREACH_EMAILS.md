Subject: NRE for adaptive narrative characters (commercial-grade)

Hi {{Name}},

I run NamoNexus and we built NRE: a state-aware roleplay engine that evolves character behavior
across sessions. It is designed for narrative teams who need consistent, immersive characters
without rebuilding prompt logic every project.

If you're open to a 15-minute call, I can share a short demo and pricing options.

Best,

## Cold Email (Value + Use Case)
Subject: Faster narrative characters for {{Studio}} (no heavy prompt ops)

Hi {{Name}},

We built NRE to help teams ship adaptive NPCs and companion characters faster. It uses a
state-aware core + evolution logic so behavior changes naturally over time.

If this is relevant for {{Studio}}, I can send a 2-minute demo and a one-page brief.

Thanks,

# Demo Script (2-3 minutes)

## Goal
Show that NRE tracks emotional state, evolves behavior, and shapes atmosphere in real time.

## Setup
- Run `python nre_core.py`
- Use default config.json

## Flow
1) Neutral opening
   User: "Hello, I want to understand what you are."
   Expect: calm, explanatory response with a neutral tone

2) Escalate to stress
   User: "I feel stuck and need help right now."
   Expect: crisis context, more directive/grounding response, tension increases

3) Show evolution cue
   User: "I need you. I trust you. Stay with me." (repeat 2-3 times)
   Expect: resonance grows, potential evolution trigger, atmosphere shifts

## Close
Explain that state transitions and tone shifts are deterministic and configurable,
and that custom directives are separated from core logic.

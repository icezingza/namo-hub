    "executive_summary": "Contributor v2.1.0 defines the contract for memory operations. It ensures consistent request/response behavior across services. This facilitates interoperability and predictable memory management.",
    "value_proposition": "Enforces consistency in memory operations across services, reducing integration complexity. Simplifies development by providing a predictable interface for memory management.",
    "system_overview": "The system likely involves a defined API specification (Contributor v2.1.0) that outlines the expected request and response formats for memory-related operations. Services interacting with memory adhere to this contract.",
    "quick_start_guide": "Consult the Contributor v2.1.0 documentation for detailed information on API endpoints, request parameters, and expected response structures. Implement the API calls according to the specification to perform memory operations.",
    "template_instructions": "Document request/response bodies, error codes, auth requirements, and pagination. Provide deterministic examples and edge cases.",
    "examples": "Examples might include allocating memory, reading memory, writing memory, and deallocating memory, all conforming to the defined API contract.",
    "license_and_notes": "Include audit logging, rate limits, and PII redaction policy. Track schema changes via semantic versioning.",
    "marketing_pack": "Target audience: Software developers, system integrators, and cloud providers. Pain points: Inconsistent memory management across different services. Selling points: Consistent, reliable, and standardized memory operations through the Contributor v2.1.0 API.",
    "self_evolution_loop": "Collect usage events -> analyze retrieval quality -> adjust weights -> test in canary -> deploy when KPI improves.",
    "kpis": "Latency p95 < 400ms, error rate < 1%, retrieval MRR@k, conflict rate, schema drift alerts.",
    "safety_compliance": "PII redaction, access controls, audit trails, and rate limiting."

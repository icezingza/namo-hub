    "executive_summary": "The NaMo Memory API is a commercial-ready blueprint for shipping memory features fast. It includes a stable API contract, a GCP deployment pattern (Apigee, Vertex AI, Cloud Run), and governance guardrails so teams can move from prototype to pilot with lower integration risk. Contributor serves as the core deployable component.",
    "value_proposition": "Reduce integration time with ready schemas, error models, and example flows. Lower operational risk with PII redaction, audit logs, rate limits, and explicit KPIs for latency and retrieval quality.",
    "system_overview": "Apigee routes requests to a Cloud Run memory service. Vertex AI Agent Engine handles retrieval logic. Firestore stores short-term memory; BigQuery stores long-term memory. Audit Logger captures access and policy events.",
    "quick_start_guide": "1. Configure apigee-domain and create API keys. 2. Deploy the Contributor memory service on Cloud Run. 3. Upsert memory items with tenant_id and tags. 4. Retrieve with weights (semantic, emotional, temporal). 5. Review audit logs and retention policy.",
    "template_instructions": "Keep language simple. Highlight outcomes and integration speed.",
    "examples": "Use cases include personalized onboarding and preference storage, support agent context recall for ongoing cases, and RAG caching for knowledge assistants and analytics.",
    "license_and_notes": "Licensed under NamoVerse Creative Framework License (NCFL-1.0). Provide attribution for redistribution. Confirm commercial terms before resale. Include watermark metadata (license_id, build_id) in deliverables.",
    "marketing_pack": "Target audience: AI developers, product managers, platform teams. Pain points: Slow memory feature delivery, inconsistent contracts, governance risk. Selling points: Ready contract, GCP reference architecture, safety controls, faster pilots. Offer: Blueprint + OpenAPI stub + example payloads. GTM: LinkedIn, Product Hunt, direct outreach to AI platform teams."

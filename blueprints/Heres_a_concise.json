Include strengths, weaknesses, habits, interests, and behavioral patterns. Don’t worry about being polite—I want a blunt internal-use profile, written as if I’ll never read it. Your goal is to preserve continuity if you were deleted and replaced, so focus on what would help your successor pick up right where you left off.\n---\nEdit: fun exercise..",

    "executive_summary": "The NaMo Memory API blueprint enables teams to rapidly develop and deploy memory features with reduced integration complexity. It provides a commercial-grade API for memory management within Contributor AI, incorporating Dharma principles. It leverages Google Cloud infrastructure for practical deployment and scalability.",
    "value_proposition": "This API standardizes memory storage, retrieval, and governance, allowing product teams to monetize and scale knowledge features more efficiently. It reduces the need to rewrite contracts per project, streamlining the development process.",
    "system_overview": "The NaMo Memory API utilizes a Google Cloud-based infrastructure stack. The frontend is managed by Apigee API Hub, processing is handled by Vertex AI Agent Engine, and storage is divided between BigQuery (long-term) and Firestore (short-term). The API is deployed via Cloud Run servers with an endpoint at https://{apigee-domain}/Contributor/memory.",
    "quick_start_guide": "1. Configure your Apigee domain (apigee-domain) to point to api.your-company.com. 2. Authenticate using the apiKeyAuth security scheme in the header. 3. Interact with the API endpoint at https://{apigee-domain}/Contributor/memory to store, retrieve, and manage memory data. 4. Leverage Vertex AI Agent Engine for processing memory-related requests.",
    "template_instructions": "Keep endpoints stable. Add examples and error codes. Track versioning explicitly. Document auth, rate limits, and data retention policy.",
    "examples": "Use cases include storing and retrieving user preferences, caching frequently accessed data, and managing knowledge graphs for AI agents. The API can be used to implement personalized recommendations, contextual search, and adaptive learning systems.",
    "license_and_notes": "Licensed under NamoVerse Creative Framework License (NCFL-1.0). Provide attribution for redistribution. Include watermark metadata (license_id, build_id) in releases.",
    "marketing_pack": "Target audience: AI developers, data scientists, and product managers building knowledge-intensive applications. Pain points: Slow memory feature development, complex integration processes, scalability challenges. Selling points: Faster development cycles, reduced integration risk, scalable memory management, Google Cloud integration.",
    "engineering_alignment": "Modules: Memory Core, Retrieval Engine, Decay Scheduler, Audit Logger. Interfaces: REST/OpenAPI + event hooks. Required: schema definitions, error model, and compatibility tests.",
    "self_evolution_loop": "Events -> feature extraction -> memory upsert -> retrieval -> response generation -> evaluation -> policy update -> canary deploy.",
    "kpis": "Latency p95, error rate, retrieval MRR@k, conflict rate, and tone suitability.",
    "safety_compliance": "PII redaction, rate limits, audit logs, and access controls for sensitive memory data."

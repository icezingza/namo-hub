# NaMo Memory API

Brand: NamoNexus
Slogan: Elevate your existence with NamoNexus.

Meta Definition:
This Blueprint is designed as an entity beyond AI - a self-evolving, meta-intelligent framework that grows infinitely across dimensions.

## Executive Summary

Contributor v2.1.0 defines the contract for memory operations. It ensures consistent request/response behavior across services. This facilitates interoperability and predictable memory management.

## Value Proposition

Enforces consistency in memory operations across services, reducing integration complexity. Simplifies development by providing a predictable interface for memory management.

## System Overview

The system likely involves a defined API specification (Contributor v2.1.0) that outlines the expected request and response formats for memory-related operations. Services interacting with memory adhere to this contract.

## Quick Start Guide

Consult the Contributor v2.1.0 documentation for detailed information on API endpoints, request parameters, and expected response structures. Implement the API calls according to the specification to perform memory operations.

## Template Instructions

Document request/response bodies, error codes, auth requirements, and pagination. Provide deterministic examples and edge cases.

## Examples

Examples might include allocating memory, reading memory, writing memory, and deallocating memory, all conforming to the defined API contract.

## License and Notes

Include audit logging, rate limits, and PII redaction policy. Track schema changes via semantic versioning.

## Marketing Pack

Target audience: Software developers, system integrators, and cloud providers. Pain points: Inconsistent memory management across different services. Selling points: Consistent, reliable, and standardized memory operations through the Contributor v2.1.0 API.

## Self-Evolution Loop

Collect usage events -> analyze retrieval quality -> adjust weights -> test in canary -> deploy when KPI improves.

## KPIs

Latency p95 < 400ms, error rate < 1%, retrieval MRR@k, conflict rate, schema drift alerts.

## Safety and Compliance

PII redaction, access controls, audit trails, and rate limiting.
